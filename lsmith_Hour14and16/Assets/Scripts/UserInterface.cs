/* 1: Added a background to the UI.  I choose this because I think it feels pretty good with the theme of the UI and eventually game
 
 * 2: Added text/ buttons to the UI.  WHich includes the title, credits, instructions on the goal, and start button that will eventually transistion to a game scene
 
 * Added music to capture the theme of this game. Was going to add a OST from Silent Hill but I opted not to 
 
 * Attempted to add a static gif of a rotating skull as seen in my hour 14 assests but was unsuccessful of showing it in my scene.

/* 1) Yes, the game is definitely too easy to beat.  All you're doing is pushing balls to the corners after all

2) 2) This game would be easier if there was only one and the player had faster movement.  And this would be harder if there was more balls and the player was slower

3) A wow factor for me would adding music to the game.  Can't have a game without music

4) It was fun moving the ball around to the goal.  It's exactly like playing soccer.  Nothing in the game was tedious


AFTER

I made the player slower so you can't win the game within 3 seconds.  I added more balls and music as well.  Can't have a game without any music
